A BDD tool for writing specifications using Given-When-Then template
====================================================================

The goal of *pyhistorian* is to write an internal Given-When-Then template using Python.
The ideas came from JBehave, RBehave, Cucumber and others.

It's possible to write your stories in English and Portuguese, choose your preferred.

A good example of use ``[en-us, by default]`` follows (call this file *calculator.py*)::

    from should_dsl import *
    from pyhistorian import *

    class Calculator(object):
        def sum(self, n1, n2):
            return n1+n2


    class SpecifyingMyNewCalculator(Story):
        """As a lazy mathematician
           I want to use a calculator
           So that I don't waste my time thinking"""
        colored = True
        template_color = 'yellow'
        scenarios = ['SumScenario'] # optional


    class SumScenario(Scenario):
        @Given('I have a calculator')
        def set_my_calculator(self):
            self.calculator = Calculator()

        @When('I enter with 1 + 1')
        def sum_one_to_one(self):
            self.result = self.calculator.sum(1, 1)

        @Then('I have $value as result', 2)
        def get_result(self, value):
            self.result |should_be| value


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        SpecifyingMyNewCalculator.run()

Running::

    $ python calculator.py 
    Story: Specifying my new calculator
    As a lazy mathematician
    I want to use a calculator
    So that I don't waste my time thinking

    Scenario 1: Sum of 1 and 1
      Given I have a calculator   ... OK
      When I enter with 1 + 1   ... OK
      Then I have 2 as result   ... OK

    Ran 1 scenarios with 0 failures, 0 errors and 0 pending steps
